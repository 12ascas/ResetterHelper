# Resetter Helper v1.0

- Resetter only needs two files to be compatible with a distro, the first is a stock manifest file, the second is the stock userlist. ResetterHelper can be doesn't need to be installed and can be run on a new system to generate those files.
- With the help of volunteers running this program on a stock debian based system and submitting their generated files, Resetter will be compatible with virtually any debian based os whether x86, amd64 or arm.
- This is the app that will help resetter spread to other debian based distros.
